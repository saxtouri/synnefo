Extented django management module

Most of the code is shared from django.core.management module
to allow us extend the default django ManagementUtility object
used to provide command line interface of the django project
included in snf-webproject package.

The extended class provides the following:

- additional argument for the configuration of the SYNNEFO_SETTINGS_DIR
  environmental variable (--settings-dir).
- a fix for management utility to handle custom commands defined in
  applications living in namespaced packages (django ticket #14087)
- override of --version command to display the snf-webproject version
